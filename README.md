# Farmers' Market Finder
A tool for exploring nearby farmers' markets using the US Dept. of Agriculture's Farmers' Market API and the Flickr photo search API.

To run the app, go to http://dabney.github.io/FrontEndNanoP5/build.

The default location is preset to San Francisco, CA.  

To find farmers' markets in a different location, use the textbox in the upper right that says, "Enter a different city".

To get more information and sample Flickr photos for a market, click on the markets map marker, 
or select it in the list on the right.

To filter the markets, enter the market name or partial name, street, zip, products, days, etc. in the textbox that
says, "Enter a name, street, zip, ..." and click the magnifying glass button.

To toggle the menu & list click on the menu bar at the top (or menu button at the top right on mobile devices).

Details on the resources used to create this app are available in the ResourcesUsed file in this repository.
