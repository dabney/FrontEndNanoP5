# Farmers' Market Finder
A tool for finding nearby farmers' markets using the US Dept. of Agriculture's Farmers' Map API.  When available,
photos retrieved from Flickr using the Flickr search API will be displayed alongside detailed information about
each market in the market's infowindow.

To run the app, go to http://dabney.github.io/FrontEndNanoP5/build.
The default location is preset to San Francisco, CA.  To find farmers' markets in a different location, 
use the textbox in the upper right that says, "Enter a different city".
To get more information about a market, click on the markets map marker, or select it in the list on the right.
